## Problem Overview
This Power BI dashboard project was designed for AtliQ, a global company experiencing rapid growth. As their operations scaled, so did the complexity of their data, leading to heavy reliance on Excel, which hindered efficiency and decision-making. This project resolves these issues by transforming AtliQâ€™s reporting ecosystem into a dynamic, real-time analytical solution using Power BI.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ faced operational bottlenecks due to fragmented data stored in spreadsheets. The lack of real-time analytics led to missed business opportunities, especially in fast-moving markets. Leadership had no unified visibility across departments like Sales, Market Reach, and Account Performance. Thus, a centralized, scalable reporting solution was necessary to unlock actionable insights.

## Objectives
Replace Excel-based reports with an interactive Power BI dashboard.
Enable end-to-end visibility into sales, products, market sectors, regions, and team performance.
Provide stakeholders with real-time, self-service BI capability.
Improve operational decision-making through intelligent KPIs and visualizations.
